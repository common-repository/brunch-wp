A tiny plugin to add Brunch app links to your recipes.

== Description ==

This tiny little plugin adds a couple links to your recipe cards! These links save the recipe to the Brunch app, which helps people remember to come back and cook the recipe and allows them to connect with bloggers on the app.

What is Brunch? Brunch is a creator-focused recipe app. We're finding new ways to connect food bloggers with their audience to grow relationships, monetize sustainably, and provide an amazing recipe experience.

Interested in working with us? Email us at support@brunch.so - we'd love to chat!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to be a Brunch Creator to use this plugin? =

Nope! You can install and use the plugin without being one of our Brunch Creators.

= How does this plugin benefit me if I'm not a Brunch Creator? =

Your readers will be able to save your recipes to Brunch, which makes them more likely to come back and actually cook the recipe later.
